Supabase and Mercado Pago APIs (Checkout Pro) were integrated for authentication, data handling, and payment processing. The system allows the admin to log in, manage user bookings, create packages, and monitor appointments. Users, without needing an account, can choose available dates and times, enter their information, and confirm a booking through online payment. Upon successful payment, a webhook confirms the reservation and sends a confirmation email with a unique reservation code.",
